# THIS MOD HAS BEEN FIXED BY TYPPI

I TRIED TO REACH OUT TO MURGH MULTIPLE TIMES WITH NO LUCK. IF HE WANTS THIS REMOVED, IT WILL BE REMOVED.

Expand your prison with a Cotton Plantation and a Jeans Factory. Plantation Workers and Prisoners will tend cotton in your plantation, bring it to your factory and produce jeans out of spools of cloth with Tailors.
